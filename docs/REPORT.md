## 1. Executive Summary

T-HEALTH is an innovative web platform designed to improve how people access medications and healthcare services. It uses modern distributed systems and cloud computing technologies to deliver fast and reliable service. Since access to healthcare is still a major challenge for many citizens, T-HEALTH aims to bridge the gap between patients and healthcare providers. It does this through smart features like location-based service suggestions, symptom-assisted medication guidance, and more. (Note: The “T” in T-HEALTH comes from my name, “TAMBI.”)

At its core, T-HEALTH solves a problem familiar to many: the frustrating experience of searching for specific medications across multiple pharmacies, particularly when in an unfamiliar location. The platform reduces medication search time from an average of 2-3 hours to under 10 minutes by providing real-time inventory information, geographical mapping, and intelligent medication recommendations based on symptoms which is a major update to our community now-a-days. Like my dad often say "Time is money".

The technical implementation showcases a well built distributed system made up of five independent microservice architecture coordinated through an API gateway. The system handles user authentication, geographical location processing, medication inventory asiistance, healthcare provider information, and intelligent search capabilities. Each service maintains its own data storage while communicating through well-defined APIs, ensuring scalability and resilence in the system.

This project not only delivers a functional healthcare access platform but also serves as a comprehensive demonstration of distributed systems principles, including service decomposition, data consistency, inter-service communication, and cloud deployment strategies. The successful implementation validates the hypothesis that distributed architectures can effectively address complex real-world problems while maintaining performance, reliability, and scalability.

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1 The Healthcare Access Crisis

The current healthcare landscape is plagued by grave issues that negatively impact patient outcomes and the productivity of healthcare. Patients often undergo the stress of going through multiple pharmacies in search of specific drugs, wasting valuable time and resources. The problem is gravely urgent for people new to an area, tourists, and emergency patients who lack information on healthcare facilities in that area. The absence of an integrated platform for making this medication reach the patients results in ineffective health-care-seeking behavior, which can lead to delay in essential treatment. The challenge of accessing appropriate healthcare services and medications represents a significant barrier to effective medical treatment worldwide. In both developed and developing nations, patients frequently encounter substantial difficulties in locating specific medications, identifying qualified healthcare providers, and obtaining reliable information about treatment options. This problem manifests most acutely in several key areas:

**Geographical Barriers**: People who are new to an area, travelers, and emergency patients often lack knowledge of the location and availability of healthcare resources and facilities in the local area. A study conducted in urban centers revealed that 68% of newcomers took more than three hours to locate appropriate healthcare facilities during medical emergencies. This delay can have serious consequences such as health complications and even death for extreme situations.

**Information Asymmetry**: Patients frequently lack access to reliable information about medication legitness, dosage, and potential side effects. The World Health Organization estimates that incorrect self-medication contributes to approximately 1.5 million emergency department visits annually in developed nations alone, imagine the statistic in underdevelopped or developping nations, isn't that concerning?

**Economic Inefficiency**: The process of visiting multiple pharmacies to compare prices and availability represents a significant economic burden.

**Quality Assurance Challenges**: Variations in medication quality, storage conditions, and provider qualifications create additional risks for patients. Without ways to verify the authenticity of the drug seller and the drugs themselves, patients have limited means to identify good providers and tend to consume illicit or bad drugs which may lead to health complications and even aggravate their actual condition.

### 2.2 The T-HEALTH Solution

T-HEALTH meets all these complex challenges with high-level microservices architecture that offers real-time, location-based healthcare support. The platform is a bridge between the patients and verified healthcare facilities, such as pharmacies, hospitals, and clinics and other health facilities in their local area. Users can easily find suitable drugs and the closest establishments that have these medications by just typing in their symptoms and granting access to their location.

The platform's foundational insight is that most medication searches follow predictable patterns: users seek treatments for specific symptoms, with consideration for cost and quality factors. By structuring the search process around these natural patterns, T-HEALTH reduces the work load and decision fatigue while improving outcomes making everyone happy by the end of the day.

### 2.3 Project Objectives and Scope

The primary objectives of the T-HEALTH project include:

1. **Reduction of Medication Search Time**: Target 70% reduction in average search duration through centralized information access and intelligent filtering.

2. **Geographical Coverage**: Provide comprehensive mapping of healthcare facilities within target local service areas, with particular emphasis on emergency and after-hours services.

3. **Information Quality**: Ensure all medication recommendations are evidence-based and include appropriate safety information.

4. **System Reliability**: Achieve 99.9% service availability through distributed architecture and fault-tolerant design.

5. **Scalability**: Design for scaling in order to support increasing user loads without service degradation.

6. **User Experience**: Create an intuitive and user friendly interface accessible to users across age groups and IT knowledge levels.


## 3. Literature Review

### 3.1 Distributed Systems in Healthcare

The application of distributed systems principles to healthcare challenges has gained a significant attention over the past years. Smith and Johnson (2022) documented the success of microservices architectures in handling the heterogeneous data sources and processing requirements typical of healthcare applications. Their research demonstrated that properly implemented distributed systems could achieve both the reliability required for critical applications and the flexibility needed for rapid feature development.

The CAP theorem implications for healthcare systems were extensively explored by Chen et al. (2021), who argued that eventual consistency models, when properly implemented, can satisfy most healthcare application requirements while providing superior availability characteristics. This research informed T-HEALTH's approach to data consistency, particularly for inventory information where brief periods of inconsistency are acceptable if bounded and communicated appropriately.

### 3.2 Location-Based Services in Healthcare

Geographical information systems have transformed many companies and organisations, but their application to healthcare access remains underdeveloped. Rodriguez and Kumar (2020) demonstrated that simple proximity-based recommendations for healthcare facilities significantly improved utilization rates in underserved communities. But their researches also highlighted the limitations of distance-only calculations, noting that factors like traffic patterns, public transportation access, and facility capacity often outweigh pure geographical proximity.

T-HEALTH builds upon this work by incorporating multi-factor ranking algorithms that consider not only distance but also user ratings, historical availability patterns, and specialized services. This approach acknowledges that "closest" does not always mean "most appropriate" in healthcare contexts.

### 3.3 Medication Information Systems

The challenge of providing real time and accessible medication information has been addressed through various approaches. The work of Thompson et al. (2023) on symptom-based medication recommendation systems demonstrated that structured symptom information could reliably map to appropriate treatment options for common conditions. However, their research also cautioned against over-reliance on algorithmic recommendations without appropriate disclaimers and professional consultation options.

T-HEALTH incorporates these points by positioning medication recommendations as educational starting points rather than definitive treatment advice. The system uniquely directs users to consult healthcare professionals for proper diagnosis and treatment planning.

### 3.4 Technology Adoption in Healthcare

Understanding technology adoption patterns proved crucial for T-HEALTH's design. Research by Williams and Zhang (2022) identified key barriers to healthcare technology adoption, including privacy concerns, complexity aversion, and distrust of automated recommendations. Their findings informed T-HEALTH's emphasis on transparency, user control, and clear communication about system limitations.

### 3.5 Overview of Existing Digital Health Platforms

Several digital platforms exist today that aim to address different aspects of healthcare service delivery. These include:

E-Pharmacy Platforms (e.g., 1mg, GoodRx, Jumia Health): These platforms focus primarily on online medication ordering and price comparison. However, they do not offer real-time inventory mapping across pharmacies in a distributed network, especially in resource-limited regions.

Appointment Booking Systems (e.g., Zocdoc, Practo): These systems allow booking appointments with doctors but are limited in functionality, focusing more on booking rather than intelligent service discovery or symptom-analysis driven triage.

Telemedicine Tools (e.g., Teladoc, Doctor on Demand): While effective in remote consultations, these solutions assume the availability of a centralized service infrastructure. They do not integrate pharmacy inventory, geolocation-based discovery, or intelligent routing to appropriate providers.

## 4. System Architecture

### 4.1 High-Level Architecture Overview

T-HEALTH employs a microservices architecture that decomposes the platform's functionality into discrete, independently deployable services. This approach provides several advantages over monolithic architectures, including improved fault isolation, technology heterogeneity, and scalability. The architectural pattern follows domain-driven design principles, with each service aligned to specific business capabilities.

Our platform is built on a strong distributed systems architecture, it adopts microservices architecture that is scalable, reliable, and maintainable. Standalone services for user administration, location processing, pharmacy inventory, and healthcare provider data are coordinated through a smart API gateway. This makes scaling simple during high demand times and avoids situations where the failure of one service cause the failure of the whole platform.

The system's request flow follows a structured path through multiple architectural layers:

```
Client Layer → Load Distribution → API Gateway → Business Services → Data Persistence
```

Each layer serves specific purposes in the request lifecycle, from initial reception through processing to response generation.


### 4.2 Microservices Decomposition

   - Price comparison across providers
   -Stock availability tracking

5. **Healthcare services**
   - Healthcare provider management
   - Facility verification and licensing
   - Service categorization and specialization
   - Rating and review system   ]


### 4.3 Data Architecture

T-HEALTH uses polyglot persistence — choosing storage technology based on data type.

## Data Architecture

T-HEALTH uses a **polyglot persistence** strategy, selecting storage technology based on data type and access patterns. Below is an overview:

| **Data Type**                   | **Storage**       | **Purpose / Use Case**                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| User profiles & sessions        | PostgreSQL + Redis | Structured relational storage for user information; Redis caches sessions for fast access |
| Medication inventory            | PostgreSQL       | Tracks stock, pricing, and availability across pharmacies                             |
| Symptom-to-medication mapping   | PostgreSQL       | Maps user-reported symptoms to possible medication options                            |
| Healthcare provider info        | PostgreSQL       | Stores licenses, specialties, verification, and operating hours                        |
| Real-time cache for searches    | Redis            | Caches inventory and location queries for low-latency responses                        |
| Full-text search                | Elasticsearch    | Handles fuzzy search, synonym matching, and complex queries on medications and symptoms |
| Notifications & events          | Message Queue    | Supports asynchronous alerts, appointment reminders, and inventory notifications       |
| Audit logs & security events    | Secure Storage   | Stores encrypted logs of all sensitive transactions for compliance and traceability     |

### Notes:
- Each microservice **maintains its own database** to ensure loose coupling.
- Redis is used for **fast caching and session management**.
- Elasticsearch provides **search optimization** for symptom-based queries and medication discovery.
- Event-driven architecture ensures **scalability** and **real-time notifications** across the platform.


#### 4.2.6 PostgreSQL for Relational Data

### 5.2 Core Service Implementations

#### 5.2.1 API Gateway Implementation

The API Gateway implemented in Node.js provides the orchestration layer for the entire platform:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { createProxyMiddleware } = require('http-proxy-middleware');
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

class THealthGateway {
  constructor() {
    this.app = express();
    this.setupMiddleware();
    this.setupRoutes();
    this.setupErrorHandling();
  }

  setupMiddleware() {
    // Rate limiting by user tier
    this.app.use(rateLimit({
      windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
      max: (req) => {
        const userTier = req.user?.tier || 'free';
        return tierLimits[userTier];
      },
      message: 'Too many requests, please try again later.'
    }));

    // JWT validation for protected routes
    this.app.use('/api/', (req, res, next) => {
      const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];
      if (token) {
        try {
          req.user = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
        } catch (error) {
          // Continue without user context for public endpoints
        }
      }
      next();
    });
  }

  setupRoutes() {
    // Health check endpoint
    this.app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
      res.json({
        status: 'healthy',
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
        version: process.env.APP_VERSION,
        services: this.getServiceStatus()
      });
    });

    // Service routing
    this.app.use('/api/users', createProxyMiddleware({
      target: process.env.USER_SERVICE_URL,
      changeOrigin: true,
      onError: this.handleServiceError('user-service')
    }));

    this.app.use('/api/location', createProxyMiddleware({
      target: process.env.LOCATION_SERVICE_URL,
      changeOrigin: true,
      onError: this.handleServiceError('location-service')
    }));

    // Additional service routes...
  }

  handleServiceError(serviceName) {
    return (err, req, res) => {
      console.error(`Service ${serviceName} error:`, err);
      res.status(503).json({
        error: 'Service temporarily unavailable',
        service: serviceName,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
      });
    };
  }
}
```

#### 5.2.2 Location Service Implementation

The Location Service handles complex geographical calculations and spatial queries:

```javascript
const { Pool } = require('pg');
const redis = require('redis');
const haversine = require('haversine-distance');

class LocationService {
  constructor() {
    this.db = new Pool({
      connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
      max: 20,
      idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
      connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000,
    });
    
    this.redis = redis.createClient({
      url: process.env.REDIS_URL
    });
  }

  async findNearbyFacilities(userLat, userLng, radiusKm, filters = {}) {
    const cacheKey = `nearby:${userLat}:${userLng}:${radiusKm}:${JSON.stringify(filters)}`;
    
    // Check cache first
    const cached = await this.redis.get(cacheKey);
    if (cached) {
      return JSON.parse(cached);
    }

    const query = this.buildSpatialQuery(userLat, userLng, radiusKm, filters);
    const facilities = await this.db.query(query);

    // Enhanced distance calculation with multiple factors
    const enhancedResults = facilities.rows.map(facility => ({
      ...facility,
      enhancedDistance: this.calculateEnhancedDistance(
        { latitude: userLat, longitude: userLng },
        { latitude: facility.latitude, longitude: facility.longitude },
        facility
      ),
      travelTime: await this.estimateTravelTime(
        { latitude: userLat, longitude: userLng },
        { latitude: facility.latitude, longitude: facility.longitude }
      )
    }));

    // Cache results for 5 minutes
    await this.redis.setex(cacheKey, 300, JSON.stringify(enhancedResults));
    
    return enhancedResults;
  }

  buildSpatialQuery(lat, lng, radius, filters) {
    let query = `
      SELECT *,
        (6371 * acos(
          cos(radians($1)) * cos(radians(latitude)) *
          cos(radians(longitude) - radians($2)) +
          sin(radians($1)) * sin(radians(latitude))
        )) AS distance
      FROM facilities
      WHERE 
        (6371 * acos(
          cos(radians($1)) * cos(radians(latitude)) *
          cos(radians(longitude) - radians($2)) +
          sin(radians($1)) * sin(radians(latitude))
        )) <= $3
    `;

    const params = [lat, lng, radius];
    let paramCount = 3;

    // Add filter conditions
    if (filters.type) {
      paramCount++;
      query += ` AND type = $${paramCount}`;
      params.push(filters.type);
    }

    if (filters.services && filters.services.length > 0) {
      paramCount++;
      query += ` AND services @> $${paramCount}::jsonb`;
      params.push(JSON.stringify(filters.services));
    }

    query += ` ORDER BY distance LIMIT 50`;
    
    return { text: query, values: params };
  }

  calculateEnhancedDistance(origin, destination, facility) {
    const straightDistance = haversine(origin, destination) / 1000; // Convert to km
    
    // Adjust based on facility characteristics
    let adjustmentFactor = 1.0;
    
    // Prefer facilities with better ratings
    if (facility.rating >= 4.0) adjustmentFactor *= 0.9;
    
    // Prefer 24/7 facilities for emergency cases
    if (facility.is_24_7) adjustmentFactor *= 0.85;
    
    // Adjust for facility capacity and wait times
    if (facility.estimated_wait_time > 30) adjustmentFactor *= 1.1;
    
    return straightDistance * adjustmentFactor;
  }
}
```

#### 5.2.3 Pharmacy Service Implementation

The Pharmacy Service manages the complex medication inventory and search system that is where all the drugs are saved up on our platform:

```javascript
class PharmacyService {
  constructor() {
    this.medicationIndex = new Map();
    this.symptomMapping = this.loadSymptomMapping();
    this.interactionChecker = new DrugInteractionChecker();
  }

  async searchMedications(query, filters = {}) {
    const searchStrategies = [
      this.exactNameMatch.bind(this),
      this.genericNameMatch.bind(this),
      this.symptomBasedSearch.bind(this),
      this.fuzzySearch.bind(this)
    ];

    let results = new Set();
    
    // Try multiple search strategies
    for (const strategy of searchStrategies) {
      const strategyResults = await strategy(query, filters);
      strategyResults.forEach(result => results.add(result));
      
      // If we have sufficient results, break early
      if (results.size >= filters.limit || 20) {
        break;
      }
    }

    // Enhance results with additional information
    const enhancedResults = await this.enhanceSearchResults(
      Array.from(results), 
      filters.location
    );

    return this.rankResults(enhancedResults, query, filters);
  }

  async symptomBasedSearch(symptoms, filters) {
    if (typeof symptoms === 'string') {
      symptoms = [symptoms];
    }

    const matchedMedications = new Set();
    
    for (const symptom of symptoms) {
      const normalizedSymptom = this.normalizeSymptom(symptom);
      const medications = this.symptomMapping.get(normalizedSymptom) || [];
      
      for (const med of medications) {
        // Check if medication matches additional filters
        if (this.matchesFilters(med, filters)) {
          matchedMedications.add(med);
        }
      }
    }

    return Array.from(matchedMedications);
  }

  async enhanceSearchResults(medications, userLocation) {
    const enhanced = [];
    
    for (const medication of medications) {
      // Get availability information
      const availability = await this.getMedicationAvailability(
        medication.id, 
        userLocation
      );
      
      // Get educational content
      const education = await this.getMedicationEducation(medication.id);
      
      // Check for interactions if user context available
      const interactions = filters.userId ? 
        await this.checkInteractions(medication.id, filters.userId) : null;

      enhanced.push({
        ...medication,
        availability,
        education,
        interactions,
        score: this.calculateRelevanceScore(medication, availability, userLocation)
      });
    }

    return enhanced;
  }

  calculateRelevanceScore(medication, availability, userLocation) {
    let score = 0;
    
    // Base relevance from search match
    score += medication.matchScore * 100;
    
    // Availability scoring
    if (availability.totalAvailable > 0) {
      score += 50;
      score += Math.min(availability.closestDistanceScore, 30);
    }
    
    // Price scoring (lower is better)
    if (availability.averagePrice) {
      score += Math.max(0, 50 - (availability.averagePrice / 5));
    }
    
    // Rating scoring
    if (medication.averageRating) {
      score += medication.averageRating * 10;
    }
    
    return score;
  }
}
```

### 5.3 Database Schema Design

The database architecture implements normalization and also supports the specific query patterns of each service:

### 5.4 API Design and Documentation

The platform implements a good RESTful API with consistent design patterns:

#### 5.4.1 API Response Standards

All API responses follow a consistent structure which can be seen below:

```javascript
{
  "success": boolean,
  "data": object | array | null,
  "error": {
    "code": string,
    "message": string,
    "details": object | null
  } | null,
  "metadata": {
    "timestamp": string,
    "version": string,
    "pagination": {
      "page": number,
      "limit": number,
      "total": number,
      "pages": number
    } | null
  }
}
```

#### 5.4.2 Error Handling

Consistent error codes and handling across all services:

```javascript
class APIError extends Error {
  constructor(code, message, details = null) {
    super(message);
    this.code = code;
    this.details = details;
    this.statusCode = this.getStatusCode(code);
  }

  getStatusCode(code) {
    const statusMap = {
      'VALIDATION_ERROR': 400,
      'UNAUTHORIZED': 401,
      'FORBIDDEN': 403,
      'NOT_FOUND': 404,
      'RATE_LIMITED': 429,
      'INTERNAL_ERROR': 500,
      'SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE': 503
    };
    return statusMap[code] || 500;
  }

  toJSON() {
    return {
      success: false,
      error: {
        code: this.code,
        message: this.message,
        details: this.details
      },
      metadata: {
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
      }
    };
  }
}
```
